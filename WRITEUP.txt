         specified.
        -File system system calls are correct as provided.
        -Programs are provided with adequate stack space to avoid overflow

    + Functions added and in which file.

    + Functions modified and in which file.
		
V. Testing: (For each test case, you must show)
    + How to test

    -Test for Part 1:
		To show that part 1 is working, you can run matmult and sort as Nachos
		user programs from the vm directory. You can also run part3DoubleExecTest
		as a user program, which will exec 2 different matmult programs.
		
	-Tests for Part 2
		To show that part 2 is working, you can run part3DoubleForkTest as a user
		program, which will fork 2 different matmult functions and print out
		their end values.
